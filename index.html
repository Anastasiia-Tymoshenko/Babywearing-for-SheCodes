    <h1>What is Babywearing?</h1>
    <p>
      Babywearing is the practice of wearing or carrying a baby in a sling or in
      another form of carrier. Babywearing has been practiced for centuries
      around the world. In the industrialized world, babywearing has gained
      popularity in recent decades. Part of the reason for this shift is due to
      the influence of advocates of attachment parenting. Babywearing is a form
      of baby transport which can be used for as long as mutually desired, often
      until toddlerhood and beyond.

    <h2>The benefits of babywearing include:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the wearing of newborns in particular, the mothers' oxytocin levels
        are increased through the physical contact with the infant, leading to a
        more intimate maternal bond, easier breastfeeding and better care, thus
        lowering the incidence of postpartum depression and psychosomatic
        illness in the mother; similarly, the father carrying the baby has
        benefits for the paternal bond.
      </li>
      <li>
        Infants who are carried are generally calmer, as more of their
        primal/survival needs are met. The caregiver can be seen, heard,
        smelled, touched, tasted, provide feeding and the motion necessary for
        continuing neural development, gastrointestinal and respiratory health
        and to establish balance (inner ear development) and muscle tone is
        constant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parental rhythms (walking, heartbeat, etc.) can have balancing and
        soothing effects on infants.
      </li>
      <li>
        Infants are "humanized" earlier by developing socially. Babies are
        closer to people and can study facial expressions, learn languages
        faster and be familiar with body language.
      </li>
      <li>Independence is established earlier.</li>
      <li>Attachment between child and caregiver is more secure.</li>
      <li>
        Decreases risk of positional plagiocephaly ("flat head syndrome") caused
        by extended time spent in a car seat and by sleeping on the back.
      </li>
      <li>
        Appropriate babywearing, particularly inward-facing babywearing can be
        beneficial to neck muscle development, and contribute positively to
        healthy hip development.
      </li>
    </ul>
